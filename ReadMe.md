# Wait Azure DevOps Extension

This is an Azure DevOps extension that allows you to pause a build or release flow for the specified length of time. You can find it on [the Azure DevOps Marketplace here][AzureDevOpsMarketplaceExtensionUrl].

You specify the number of milliseconds, seconds, or minutes that you want the process to wait for, and it will pause for that length of time.

This extension currently on supports Windows agents, but will also support Linux / Mac agents in the future.
